Through **<span style="color: black;">this website</span>** we will share only the schedule and materials. Everything else---syllabus, announcements, discussion, turning in assignments/project components, communicating grades, policies---will be done through **<span style="color: black;">Canvas</span>**.

Please use the Canvas discussion forum as the preferred medium for interacting with the instructor and the teaching assistants rather than emailing/messaging directly. Take advantage of the instructor hours. We will work hard to be accessible to students. Don't be shy if you donâ€™t understand something: come to office hours, post in the forum, or speak up in class!

## Description

Data mining is the study of efficiently finding structures and patterns in large data sets. We will focus on several aspects of this: (1) converting from a messy and noisy raw data set to a structured and abstract one, (2) applying scalable and probabilistic algorithms to these well-structured abstract data sets, and (3) formally modeling and understanding the error and other consequences of parts (1) and (2), including choice of data representation and trade-offs between accuracy and scalability. These steps are essential for training as a data scientist.

Algorithms, programming, probability, and linear algebra are required tools for understanding these approaches.

Topics will include: similarity search, clustering, regression/dimensionality reduction, graph analysis, PageRank, and small space summaries. We will also cover several recent developments, and the application of these topics to modern applications, often relating to large internet-based companies.

Upon completion, students should be able to read, understand, and implement ideas from many data mining research papers.
