# Homework Assignments 

We will plan to have 8 short homework assignments, roughly covering each main topic in the class. The homeworks will usually consist of an analytical problems set, and sometimes a programming exercise. A preferred programming language for the class is Python.
Homework assignments make up  **40% of the final grade**. 

Standard due date times for homeworks are **2:45 PM**. 

All homework assignments must be submitted to the designated area of **Canvas**. Do  **not** submit assignments via email.

I recommend using LaTex for writing up homeworks. It is something that everyone should know for research and writing scientific documents. This [overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zzcwdgwrpmph) Links to an external site.contains a sample .tex file, as well as what its .pdf compiled outcome looks like. It also has a figure .pdf to show how to include figures. 

## Late Assignemnts 

To get full credit for an assignment, it must be turned in through Canvas by the due time.  Standard due date times for homework assignments are **2:45 PM**. You are allowed to be late with **at most two HOMEWORK (not project!) assignments no more than 48H, without penalty**. _You don't need to ask for permission._ After two homework assignments have been submitted late, once the deadline is missed, those turned in late will **lose 10%**. Every **subsequent 24 hours** until it is turned **another 10%** is deducted. Assignments will **not be accepted more than 48 hours late**, and will be given a 0. 

**Assignments will be posted far enough ahead of time that I will not be able to make additional exceptions if a student falls ill. The exception will be prolonged illness accompanied by a doctor's note.** 

## Grading 

If you believe there is an error in grading, you may request a regrading within one week of receiving your grade. Requests must be made by email to the instructor, explaining clearly why you think your solution is correct.

You can earn extra points on some homework assignments.

## Policy Statement on Academic Misconduct

The class operates under the School of Computing’s [policies and guidelines](https://handbook.cs.utah.edu/2019-2020/Academics/policies.php). Among other things, we will adhere to the [academic misconduct policy](https://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/misc/cheating_policy.pdf). More information about the policy can be found on the linked page, but we highlight this: 

> Violations of this policy are recorded as “strikes” by the SoC. A failing grade sanction in an SoC course counts as one “strike” in a student’s academic record. Two lesser sanctions in SoC courses count as one “strike” in a student’s academic record. Any student with two strikes due to academic misconduct will be subsequently barred from registering for any additional SoC courses, immediately dropped from their respective degree program, and will not be admitted to any future SoC program.

You are encouraged to discuss class materials with your peers. If you want you can form study groups because discussions help understanding. You are also welcome to discuss assignments.

However, you must write your own solutions, proofs, and code and submit your own solution. Do not copy or ask for assignments from other students or the internet. Do not let someone else copy your submissions either.

You should cite all sources that you refer to. This includes personal communication, books, papers, websites, etc. Doing so reflects academic integrity.
