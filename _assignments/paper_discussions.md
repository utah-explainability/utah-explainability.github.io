# Paper Discussions

___We follow the [CSE 599 @ UW](https://cse599d1wi23.notion.site/cse599d1wi23/CSE-599-D1-Winter-2023-fe73cb56c11b45efb34e94c090480791#948c133be7d845c6b8720e85279ecd60) version of Alec Jacobson's and Colin Raffel's [role-playing paper reading seminars](https://colinraffel.com/blog/role-playing-seminar.html). The text below is to a large extent copied from their website.___

For each class, we'll assign two required readings to discuss in class: we‚Äôll go deep into **Paper 1** in the discussion so it requires careful reading, and you can skim **Paper 2** time-permitting. We'll assign **presenters** to play the following five **roles** in each class:

**üåª**¬†**Original** **Author [5-10 min].**¬†You‚Äôre among the original authors of **Paper 1**. You‚Äôll give a 5-10min short, high-quality presentation at a conference.

**üë©üèΩ‚Äçüî¨**¬†**Scientific Peer Reviewer [3-5 min].**¬†**Paper 1** has not been published yet and is currently under review at a top conference where you‚Äôve been assigned as a peer reviewer. Complete a full review of this paper answering all prompts of the ACL [official review form](https://2023.aclweb.org/blog/review-acl23/). This includes recommending whether to accept or reject the paper.

Please do maintain a polite and considerate voice when sharing limitations about the work (as if the readers of the reviews might be yourself!) and even better if you can suggest constructive and concrete action items to improve the paper. 

**üè∫Archaeologist [3-5 min]. Paper 1** was found buried underground in the desert. You‚Äôre an archeologist who must determine where this paper sits in the context of previous and subsequent work. Find and report on one¬†*older*¬†paper cited within the current paper that substantially influenced the current paper and one¬†*newer*¬†paper that cites this current paper. Report how the older paper was influential and why a newer paper cites the current paper.

**üçú**¬†**Imaginative Researcher [3-5 min].**¬†You‚Äôre a researcher who is working on a new project in the area of **Paper 1**. Propose an imaginary follow-up project¬†*not just*¬†based on the current but only possible due to the existence and success of the current paper.

ü¶¶¬†**Original Author of a Related Paper [5-10 min].** You‚Äôre among the original authors of a related **Paper 2**. You‚Äôll give a 5-10 min short, high-quality presentation at a conference.

> Each role-playing presentation will be completed by either **an individual student** or **a team of two students**. We will use **a shared Google Slides** for all presenters to streamline the presentation. Each role-playing presentation will begin with a title page that states which role they are playing and the name(s) of the presenter(s). The presentation material can be borrowed from elsewhere so long as the original source is acknowledged.

For people who are **not** assigned as the official presenters, you will serve as the **discussion assistant** of the class by doing **one** of the following two tasks:

1. Play a ü¶Ñ¬†**Wild Card** Role **[3-5 min].**
    
    You‚Äôre welcome to play a wild card role, be it an industry practitioner, a cranky researcher, a moral philosopher, a government policy maker, an inquisitive scholar, an alien from Mars, or whatever role you want to define and play!  
    
2. Complete a **written artifacts** on any paper of your choosing from among the required and optional readings **(to be shared with the class).**
    
    üìù¬†**A study (summary) note** of a paper created in some note-taking app (e.g., Notion) 
    
    üìë¬†**A blog post** of a paper or a group of papers that reads like a tutorial
    
    üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è¬†**An opinion piece** reflecting your own thoughts and perspectives
    
    üìï¬†**A scribe** of the class discussion (key questions and discussions)
    

> Each written artifact will be completed by either **an individual student** or **a team of two students**. It should be **at least one paragraph** in length within **one week of the class takes place**. The written artifact should not contain any plagiarism (e.g., a blog post elsewhere on the same paper/topic cannot be submitted as is or even after paraphrasing). Please keep in mind that all your written artifacts will be shared with the class.


### ‚≠êÔ∏è How are you participating in each class throughout the quarter**?**

- You are required to do **regular** role-play presentations *2 times** throughout the quarter, following the assignment spreadsheet which will be shared after the second week of class when the withdrawal deadline passes.
- For the sessions when you are not presenting, you will either play a wildcard role OR write a written artifact.
    - You‚Äôll have **2 free passes** throughout the quarter.
    - You‚Äôre allowed to do the scribe role **up to 2 times**.
