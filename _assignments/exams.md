# Exams

There will be two in-person tests (mid-term and end-term), each covering roughly half the material in class. Attendence is mandatory. They will be open notes; you can bring 1 sheet of paper (front and back). No computers or calculators will be allowed. Exams make up  **20% of the final grade**. 

_No exam may be taken at a different time for any reason other than a medical emergency or conflict with another exam, and documentation may be required._


## Grading 

If you believe there is an error in grading, you may request a regrading within one week of receiving your grade. Requests must be made by email to the instructor, explaining clearly why you think your solution is correct.

## Policy Statement on Academic Misconduct

The class operates under the School of Computing’s [policies and guidelines](https://handbook.cs.utah.edu/2019-2020/Academics/policies.php). Among other things, we will adhere to the [academic misconduct policy](https://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/misc/cheating_policy.pdf). More information about the policy can be found on the linked page, but we highlight this: 

> Violations of this policy are recorded as “strikes” by the SoC. A failing grade sanction in an SoC course counts as one “strike” in a student’s academic record. Two lesser sanctions in SoC courses count as one “strike” in a student’s academic record. Any student with two strikes due to academic misconduct will be subsequently barred from registering for any additional SoC courses, immediately dropped from their respective degree program, and will not be admitted to any future SoC program.
